Given the vertices and edges between them, how could we quickly check whether two vertices are connected?

The primary use of disjoint sets is to address the connectivity between the components of a network. The ‚Äúnetwork‚Äú here can be a computer network or a social network. For instance, we can use a disjoint set to determine if two people share a common ancestor.

Parent node: the direct parent node of a vertex.
Root node: a node without a parent node; it can be viewed as the parent node of itself.

The find function finds the root node of a given vertex.
The union function unions two vertices and makes their root nodes the same.

the ‚Äúrank‚Äù refers to the height of each vertex. When we union two vertices, instead of always picking the root of x (or y, it doesn't matter as long as we're consistent) as the new root node, we choose the root node of the vertex with a larger ‚Äúrank‚Äù. We will merge the shorter tree under the taller tree and assign the root node of the taller tree as the root node for both vertices. In this way, we effectively avoid the possibility of connecting all vertices into a straight line. This optimization is called the ‚Äúdisjoint set‚Äù with union by rank.

The main idea of a ‚Äúdisjoint set‚Äù is to have all connected vertices have the same parent node or root node, whether directly or indirectly connected. To check if two vertices are connected, we only need to check if they have the same root node.

The two most important functions for the ‚Äúdisjoint set‚Äù data structure are the find function and the union function. The find function locates the root node of a given vertex. The union function connects two previously unconnected vertices by giving them the same root node. There is another important function named connected, which checks the ‚Äúconnectivity‚Äù of two vertices. The find and union functions are essential for any question that uses the ‚Äúdisjoint set‚Äù data structure.

memorize the implementation of ‚Äúdisjoint set with path compression and union by rank‚Äù.

/**
 * üéØ UNION FIND (DISJOINT SET) TEMPLATE WITH DETAILED EXPLANATIONS
 * 
 * PURPOSE: Efficiently manage disjoint sets and answer connectivity queries
 * MAIN OPERATIONS: 
 *   - find(x): Which set does x belong to?
 *   - union_set(x,y): Merge the sets containing x and y
 * 
 * KEY OPTIMIZATIONS:
 *   - Path Compression: Makes find() nearly O(1)
 *   - Union by Rank: Keeps trees shallow, prevents worst-case O(n) chains
 * 
 * TIME COMPLEXITY: O(Œ±(n)) per operation where Œ± is inverse Ackermann (nearly constant)
 * SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n)

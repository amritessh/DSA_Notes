For the graph to be a valid tree, it must have exactly n - 1 edges. Any less, and it can't possibly be fully connected. Any more, and it has to contain cycles. Additionally, if the graph is fully connected and contains exactly n - 1 edges, it can't possibly contain a cycle, and therefore must be a tree!

BFS is good to find a shortest path
DFS tells us if a path even exists

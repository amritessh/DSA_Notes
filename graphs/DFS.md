In Graph theory, the depth-first search algorithm (abbreviated as DFS) is mainly used to:

Traverse all vertices in a “graph”;
Traverse all paths between any two vertices in a “graph”.

When we traverse an adjacent vertex, we completely finish the traversal of all vertices reachable through that adjacent vertex.

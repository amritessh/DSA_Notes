duplication calculation in recursion

To eliminate the duplicate calculation. ideas would be to store the intermediate results in the cache so that we could reuse them later without re calculation, the idea is also known as memoization, which is a technique that is frequently used together with recursion.

Memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

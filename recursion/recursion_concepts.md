Recursion is an approach to solving problems using a function that calls itself a subroutine.

Each time a function calls itself, it reduces the given problem into sub  problems. 

The recursion call continues until it reaches a point where the sub problem can be solved without further recursion.

A recursive function should have - A simple base case: a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer.
A set of rules also known as recurrence relation that reduces all other cases towards the base case.

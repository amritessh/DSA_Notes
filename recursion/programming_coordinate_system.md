üß≠ Coordinate System: Why {-1,0} = UPThe Programming Grid System (Used in Code)
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2)  ‚Üê Row 0 (TOP)
(1,0) (1,1) (1,2)  ‚Üê Row 1  
(2,0) (2,1) (2,2)  ‚Üê Row 2 (BOTTOM)Key Point: Row numbers increase going DOWN, like reading lines in a book!Why UP = {-1, 0}:
Robot at (1,1) wants to go UP:
(1,1) + (-1,0) = (0,1)  ‚Üê Row decreases by 1 = moving UP!Why DOWN = {1, 0}:
Robot at (1,1) wants to go DOWN:  
(1,1) + (1,0) = (2,1)  ‚Üê Row increases by 1 = moving DOWN!Think of it like this:

Row 0 = Top shelf of bookcase
Row 1 = Middle shelf
Row 2 = Bottom shelf
Going UP = smaller row number
Going DOWN = bigger row number

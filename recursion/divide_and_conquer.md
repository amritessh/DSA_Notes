divide and conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking the problem down into two or more subproblems of the same related type, until these subproblems become simple enough to be solved directly. then one combines the results of subproblems to form the final solution.

1. divide the problem S into a set of subproblems where n>=2 i.e there are usually more than one subproblem.
2. conquer solve each problem recursively.
3. combine the results of each subproblem.

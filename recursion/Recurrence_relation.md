recurrence relation is the relationship between the result of a problem and the result of its subproblems.

base case is the case where one can compute the answer directly without any further recursion calls. sometimes, the base cases are also called bottom cases. since they are often the cases where the problem has been reduced to the minimal scale i.e. the bottom, if we consider that dividing the problem into subproblems is in a top down manner.
